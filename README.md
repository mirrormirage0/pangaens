# What does the shell scripts do ?

It is a collection of Harmony Pangaea Node commands to find 
1) Node Block number
2) Wallet Balance
3) When did my node last sync/get the bingo message?
4) Which Shard does my node belong to?
5) Is my Shard Online?

# How do I run them ?
Login to your server and issue the following commands (They are commands to get the file, give it execute privileges and execute!)
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mirrormirage0/pangaens/master/check_pangaea.sh
chmod u+x check_pangaea.sh
./check_pangaea.sh
